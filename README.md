Custom Who's On First placetypes for constituencies

## Important

This is work in progress.

This repository is meant to track custom Who's On First placetypes for constituencies. In this context "custom" is meant to represent placetypes that fall outside, but which can be integrated (merged) with, the "core" `whosonfirst-placetypes` definition.

The mechanics of that integration and the semantics of constituency placetypes remain to be determined.

For an example of similar ongoing work have a look at:
